    <h3>Marketing Plan</h3>
    <p>Our primary target market is the students, teachers, and visitors of Isulan National High School. To promote our products, we will focus on offline marketing strategies by selling our Graham balls on foot around the school premises and nearby areas during breaks and lunchtime. We will also distribute flyers and posters around the school to raise awareness of our brand.

To attract more customers, we will offer special discounts and promotions during special school events such as TVL day, where students from the Technical-Vocational Livelihood track showcase their skills and projects. We will also collaborate with student organizations to sell our products during these events.</p>

    <h3>Operational Plan</h3>
    <p>Our Graham ball production will take place in a clean and sanitary kitchen in one of our group member's house. We will be the ones who will make the product, so we won't be hiring any additional staff.

To sell our products, we will be selling them on foot by going from room to room and around the school grounds. We will not be making any stands or booths as we want to keep our expenses minimal and focus on our core operations.

To ensure the quality of our products, we will have a checklist for the ingredients and equipment needed for each batch. We will also have a standard recipe and procedure to ensure consistency in taste and presentation.</p>

    <h3>Organizational and Management Plan</h3>
    <p>Our company, Dragonballs, is a partnership between a group of students who are passionate about creating delicious treats for their fellow students and teachers. We have formed a team with several members who will work together to ensure the success of our business.

We will divide the tasks among ourselves, with each member responsible for a specific area such as production, supplies, marketing, customer service, and finance. We will work together and communicate regularly to make decisions and monitor the progress of our business.

To ensure efficient operations, we will assign a team leader who will be responsible for coordinating and delegating tasks among the members. We will also have regular meetings to discuss the challenges and opportunities we face and find ways to improve our business.</p>

    <h3>Start up Expenses and Capitalization</h3>
    <p>Our starting capital is 500 pesos. We will use this money to purchase the ingredients and supplies needed to make our products. We will carefully manage our expenses to ensure that we can produce enough products to sell without overspending.

As our product is simple and easily recognizable, we will not be using any flyers or social media to promote it. Instead, we will rely on word-of-mouth advertising and selling our products on foot around the school premises.</p>

    <h3>Financial Plan</h3>
    <p>Our starting capital is 500 pesos. We plan to produce 200 Graham balls for the TVL day event, with 100 regular and 100 special ones. We will sell the regular Graham balls for 5 pesos each and the special ones for 10 pesos each.

Total revenue from selling 100 regular Graham balls = 100 x 5 = 500 pesos
Total revenue from selling 100 special Graham balls = 100 x 10 = 1000 pesos
Total revenue for the 2-day TVL event = 500 + 1000 = 1500 pesos

Cost of ingredients and supplies for making 200 Graham balls = 300 pesos
Total expenses for printing flyers and posters = 100 pesos

Total expenses = 300 + 100 = 400 pesos

Net profit for the TVL event = 1500 - 400 = 1100 pesos

With this profit, we plan to reinvest in the business by purchasing more supplies and ingredients to expand our menu and reach a wider customer base. We aim to introduce new flavors and products that will cater to the taste of our customers. We will also use some of our profits to buy new equipment and improve our operations to increase efficiency and productivity. By doing so, we hope to grow our business and increase our profit margin over time.</p>
